# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## 🧾 Program
``` python
z=int(input())
f=lambda z:z*45
print(f(z))
```
## Output

## Result
Thus the python program which takes z as a parameter and returns z*45 is executed successfully.
